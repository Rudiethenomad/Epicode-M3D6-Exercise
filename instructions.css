Exercises
Improve your Music Albums assignment created for W7 L1

 

EXERCISES:

xx 1) Create a Jumbotron section with a quick explanation / image of the website.

 

xx2) Use a Bootstrap Card to contain every album in the favorite list you previously created.

Use the elements of a card bootstrap gives you, to display nicely the album information such as: album title, artist, year, etc..

 

xx3) For every album in the favorite list, attach a badge on the top-left corner of the album with the genre of the music.

 

xx4) Create a new section with an album tracklist inside a Bootstrap table. The row colors of the table must be alternated. There should be a column for the track order number, one for the title, one for the artist name and one for the track duration. (you can also add extra columns)

 

5) Add a DELETE button (bootstrap btn danger) at the end of each row of the tracklist. Attach the functionality to remove its row when it gets clicked. (Requires DOM manipulation)

 

xx6) Add an “Add Track” button under the tracklist of the album.

It should have a nice shadow transition when it gets hovered (with the box-shadow property) to look as if the button was elevating itself up. (you can search for more effects and add more)


xx7) On the click of “Add Track” button, a modal should appear.
(check in the documentation the modal + button example)
The modal shall contain single input fields (avoid using a <form> to wrap the inputs) with:

Track number
Track title
Artist Name
Track duration
The fields should be inside an Input Group and divided in 2 columns.


 

EXTRA

The modal should contain 2 buttons at the bottom:

Add => Adds a new track in the tracklist with the data from the input fields. (requires DOM manipulation)
Close => closes the modal
When a new track is added, notify the user with an alert message containing the name of the track

 

CSS EXTRA

Create a fade-in effect for the jumbotron of EX 1, the effect should happen upon loading the page. Figure out a way with JavaScript to make it happen.
For the delete buttons you’ve created on EX 5 make only one visible at a time, the delete button should become visible only when its row gets hovered. Animate it with a fade-in effect upon the user hovering and fade-out when he/she goes away from it.
